Why Add a Registration Feature?
1. User Management
To support multiple users (up to three, as per your requirement), there needs to be a way to create and manage user accounts. A registration feature allows new users to sign up, providing their necessary credentials and broker details.

2. Security
Registration ensures that each user has unique credentials, enhancing the security of the trading dashboard. It allows for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only registered users can access and perform trading operations.

3. Scalability
While the current requirement is for a maximum of three users, having a registration system lays the groundwork for future scalability, allowing more users to join if needed with minimal adjustments.
